# FixCate
Fixes the irritating bug in CATe for Chrome Windows users where you have to log in twice;


## How to install
Currently this can only be installed by cloning the directory and adding to chrome extensions through developer mode. It **should** be on the chrome web store soon but until then:

1. Navigate to directory where you want to store the extension and type

```
git clone https://github.com/DanKirwan/FixCate.git
```

2. Open chrome and type the URL

```
chrome://extensions
```

3. Turn on the *Developer mode* switch in the top right corner.

4. Click load unpacked and navigate to the FixCate folder and enable the extension.

## **Warning**

If you opt to save your password, **it is not stored securely** and anyone with access to your unlocked PC could get your password.

Password saving can be toggled by navigating to the extensions toolbar and clicking on the *Fix Cate* icon.
